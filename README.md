This repo holds scripts and other automation tools I am using for work at SLW.

My automation tools are divided into two parts.

The first part is made up of AutoHotkey Scripts. In addition to basic text replacement, I use AutoHotkey to write full emails and expedite repetitive tasks. The largest script I have written is AutoUpload_loop. This script automatically uploads files into the USPTO reference submission page.

AutoUpload, at this point, is 3 different scripts. There is are 2 legacy scripts and a more advance looping script. I would prefer everyone use the advanced script but some people are still using the legacy script.

The second portion of my automation tools is the JavaScript I have written to more quickly and easily manipulate FIP.
