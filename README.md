This repo holds scripts and other automation tools I am using for work at SLW.

Autohotkey scripts (espescially AutoUpload are a work in progress).

AutoUpload (at this point is 3 different scripts).  There is a legacy script, a current script and an experimental looping script.  The current script is the only one I wish to be deployed but several people are still using the legacy script.
